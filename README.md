# ofWrapTest
A simple test program to illustrate stuttering when wrapping

Project built in openFrameworks 0.9.8 release with VS2015.

Loads a simple image and scrolls it around the window.

I see the image occasionally jerk or stutter, its not smoothly scrolling.



frame rate can be adjusted with f/F keys

vsync can be toggled with v key

wrap speed can be changed with w/W keys

image can be loaded by dragging and dropping

The app saves its setting on exit, or with the f key. It loads them on start up
